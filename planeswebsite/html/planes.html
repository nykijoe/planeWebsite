      <h2> The Five Main Components of a Plane.</h2>
  <p>
    Airplanes are a remarkable feat of engineering. Our species has figured out how to get over 100,000 pounds worth 
    of metal in the air flying smoothly. Over the past century, aircraft components have evolved to make flights more 
    efficient, safer, and faster. Our aviation crew at our aircraft dispatcher school provides a brief introduction to 
    the 5 main aircraft components.
  </p> 
  <h3> The Fuselage </h3>  
  <p>
    The fuselage is one of the major aircraft components. Its long hollow tube, also known as the body of the airplane, 
    holds the passengers along with cargo. This area includes the cockpit, so the pilots are in front of the fuselage.
    Despite there being different types of fuselages, they connect the major parts of an airplane. Out of the five basic 
    parts of an airplane, this is the aircraft component that most people are most familiar with, as passengers.
  </p>
  <h3> The Wings</h3>
  <p>
    As an exterior part of an aircraft, the wings, commonly known as foils, are one of the aircraft parts that are most 
    imperative for flight. The airflow over the wings is what generates most of the lifting force necessary for flight. 
    Along with the large wings that stem from the middle of the fuselage, the wings also include two smaller ones at the 
    back of most aircraft, at the tail. Airplane wings, while seeming fairly simple, are one of the many parts of a plane 
    that has required tremendous feats of engineering.
  </p>
  <h3> The Empennage</h3>
  <p>
    The empennage is located at the tail end of the aircraft. Its two main components, the rudder and elevator, help with
     the stability of the plane. The rudder helps the aircraft steer from right to left, and the elevator helps with
     changing elevation.
  </p>
  <h3> The Power Plant </h3>
  <p>
    The power plant of an airplane structure includes the engine and the propeller. The engine itself is a complicated 
    system composed of many smaller parts like cylinders, fans, and pistons. Together, these aircraft engine parts work 
    to generate the power or thrust of an aircraft. There are various intricacies in the power plant assisting in 
    powering the aircraft, such as various aircraft fuel system components. 
  </p>
  <h3>The Landing Gear</h3>
  <p>
    You cannot have a safe plane without having the landing gear. Not only are these parts imperative to land, but the
     landing gear is also used to help an aircraft take-off and taxi. The landing gear includes shock absorbers for a 
     smooth landing and takeoff, as well as the wheels on the plane, to name a few of the aircraft components responsible
      for movements on the ground.

  <h1>Lighter-than-Air Aircraft</h1>
    <div class="square">
      <div>
        <img src="/img/blimps.jpg"  alt="sailing blimp" class="pilot">
      </div>
      <p>
        While lighter-than-air includes such things as balloons, nonrigid airships also called blimps, and dirigibles, 
        the heavier-than-air category includes the most common types of airplanes such as light jets, jumbo jets, cargo 
        planes, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focusing on the second group, we can find different subcategories. For example, we could speak about jet aircraft
         like private jets, commercial jets, and military jets. Or we could speak about how they are classified in terms 
         of the engines they use such as propeller planes, turboprop aircraft, piston aircraft, and those with gas turbine
         engines or jet engines. Also, you could use the size of the body, like narrow and wide-body planes, or by the type of their wings, 
         like the case of fixed-wing aircraft. 
      </p>  <br>    
</article>
<article>
  <h1>Heavier-than-Air Aircraft</h1>
    <div class="square">
      <div>
        <img src="/img/fighter jets.jpg"  alt="parts of a plane" class="pilot">
      </div>
      <p>
        Heavier-than-air vehicles generally achieve flight with aerodynamic lift created by airflow over a surface 
        (usually a wing). There were three basic types of early heavier-than-air vehicles -- kites, gliders and airplanes.
         Kites are unpowered, tethered craft. Gliders fly freely. Both kites and gliders are limited because they rely on 
         the airflow provided by wind to remain aloft. Airplanes are powered air vehicles that use their own propulsion to 
         create airflow over the wings.
      </p>
      <h2>Fighter Jets</h2>
      <p>
        As you can imagine, fighter jets are among the military aircraft, and they are the ones used by the air forces in
        air combat. While these airplanes are not regularly seen by most people, they are a very interesting type. Costing 
        billions of US dollars to develop, these jets are usually very fast reaching supersonic maximum speeds, and they 
        have high levels of maneuverability. As you can expect, most of them take off from air force bases, but some of 
        them can be launched from navy carriers. 

        Of course, while in combat, they usually fly fully armed, carrying any arms from machine guns to guided missiles or
        cruise missiles. Fortunately, these military aircraft are mostly used to train pilots in the air force.
      </p>
      <h2>Private Jets</h2>
      <p>
        Private jets come in many forms, but especially in many sizes. So, to better describe private jets we will use 
        their sizes.
      </p>
      <h2>Very Light Jets</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes called by the acronym VLJ, very light jets are those usually containing seats for up to eight passengers
        at the most and only capable of covering short distances. But letâ€™s not focus on the limitations only.

        These jets are great business jets options for purposes like air taxi services. Since they are small and simple, they do 
        not require an entire flight crew, but only a pilot. So, costs can be reduced, something critical for any business.
       The lightest business jets also come with decent fuel economy, making it a perfect choice for smaller business on 
       domestic flights.
      </p>
      <h2> Light Jets</h2>
      <div class="square">
        <div>
          <img src="/img/private jets.jpeg"  alt="parts of a plane" class="pilot">
        </div>
      <p>
        The main characteristic for a jet to be considered a light jet is that it must have a maximum takeoff weight of 
        20,000 pounds (about 9100 kilograms). Most light passenger jets can keep an average cruising speed of about 
        500 mph (about 805 km/h), which is at the same level as most commercial planes. This makes them a great option for
        private travel to distances longer than the ones a VLJ can cover, as these jet planes can carry passengers over 
        2,400 nautical miles or more. Another difference with the very light jets is that light business jets are 
        generally equipped with a dedicated lavatory compartment, and special technology including but not limited to a 
        satellite phone, Wi-Fi, and XM radio communications. The latter makes it possible for passengers to take care of 
        their business during the flight.

  <h1> Amphibious Aircraft</h1>
      <div class="square">
        <div>
          <img src="/img/amphibious aircraft.jpg"  alt="parts of a plane" class="pilot">
        </div>
      <p>
        As the name implies, this type of aircraft is one that can both land and take off from the water, usually from 
        calm water masses like a lake. But they are not limited to water. Amphibious planes have also been prepared to be
        used in snowy areas, and sometimes they have wheels that can be retracted, so they can either use the water or the ground to land.
        Unfortunately, to achieve all these, aircraft is usually too heavy and maintenance becomes expensive as it needs 
        to be more done more often. So, many airplanes in this category have already disappeared.
      </p>

  <h1>Non-passenger aircraft</h1>
  <div class="square">
    <div>
      <img src="/img/cargo planes.jpeg"  alt="parts of a plane" class="pilot">
    </div>
    <h2>Cargo planes</h2>
  <p>
    While some jumbo jets and commercial airplanes can be transformed into cargo aircraft, there are some manufacturers
    that create jets specifically for cargo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cargo planes require as much space available as possible to carry as much cargo as possible, but also enough power 
    and a design that is optimized to lift the large weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The largest airplane in the world, the Antonov An-225, was used for cargo missions to move supplies during the 
    COVID-19 pandemic. With a maximum takeoff weight of 710 tons, and holding the record for total airlifted payload at 
    559,580 pounds, this airplane and its six engines could basically move any cargo. Unfortunately, it was recently 
    destroyed during Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.
